# Antigravity OS - Product Specification

## Vision Statement
Antigravity OS is an autonomous engine that transforms a single product idea into a fully documented, tested, and self-healing application. It eliminates the friction between ideation and production by automating the entire software development lifecycle through spec-driven development and autonomous self-correction.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Zero-to-Production Automation**: From concept to deployed application with minimal human intervention
- **Self-Healing Architecture**: Automatic error detection, analysis, and correction without manual debugging
- **Spec-First Methodology**: Every feature begins with formal requirements and design documents
- **Continuous Validation**: Property-based testing ensures correctness at every stage

## Target Users
1. **Solo Founders**: Need to ship MVPs quickly without a full engineering team
2. **Development Teams**: Want to accelerate feature delivery and reduce technical debt
3. **Product Managers**: Require clear documentation and traceability from idea to implementation

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Spec Generation
- Natural language input → Structured requirements documents
- Automatic design document creation with correctness properties
- Task breakdown with dependency management

### 2. Autonomous Execution Engine
- Sequential task execution with progress tracking
- Automatic code generation following best practices
- Integrated testing (unit + property-based)

### 3. Ralph-Loop Self-Correction
- Real-time error detection and analysis
- Automatic spec updates based on implementation learnings
- Self-healing execution without human intervention

### 4. Integration Layer
- n8n workflow automation for external triggers
- Webhook support for CI/CD pipelines
- Local LLM validation via Ollama

## Success Metrics
- Time from idea to working prototype: < 2 hours
- Self-correction success rate: > 90%
- Test coverage: > 80%
- Documentation completeness: 100%

## Competitive Advantage
Unlike traditional no-code platforms or AI coding assistants, Antigravity OS combines:
- Formal specification methodology
- Property-based testing for correctness
- Autonomous error recovery
- Full code ownership and customization
